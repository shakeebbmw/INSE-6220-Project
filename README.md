# INSE-6220-Project
Principal Component Analysis and Machine Learning on the Wine Quality Dataset done by Shakeeb Shakeeb for INSE 6220 Final project.
## Project Description
This project analyzes the Wine Quality Dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and machine learning models for classification.

## Files
- `INSE-6220-Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
- `winequality-red.csv`: Dataset used in the project.

## Features
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Outlier detection and removal.
   - Data normalization.
2. PCA:
   - Dimensionality reduction.
   - Explained variance analysis.
3. Machine Learning:
   - Logistic Regression.
   - Random Forest with SMOTE for class imbalance.
